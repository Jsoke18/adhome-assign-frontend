## Libraries
The frontend utilizes the following libraries and frameworks:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: A library for client-side routing in React applications.
- Axios: A library for making HTTP requests from the browser.
- Ant Design/React: A UI library for building responsive and interactive user interfaces in React.
- Day.js: A lightweight JavaScript library for handling dates and times.

## Architecture and Design Choices

### React
React was chosen for its component-based architecture, promoting code reusability and maintainability, along with its efficient rendering.

### React Router
React Router enables client-side routing for a seamless single-page application experience.

### Axios
Axios provides a simple interface for making HTTP requests to the backend API and handling asynchronous requests and responses.

### Ant Design/React
The Ant Design/React UI library offers pre-built components for a visually appealing and responsive user interface, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

### Day.js
Day.js is a lightweight library used for parsing, manipulating, and formatting dates and times within the application. Ant's date-picker rely's on Day.js so it is essential to implement.
